# CNN_Cancer_Detection
This project will include a binary image classification problem where we will distinguish metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans. Computer vision machine learning techniques can be used to improve cancer detection in lymph nodes. An algorithm will be created to be able to identify these scans and will be predicted on a sample dataset of images on Kaggle to test performance. Specifically, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) will be used which is a specialized deep learning algorithm designed for object recognition. This notebook with go through the steps of describing the data, exploratory data analysis, model architecture, results, analysis, and conclusion. The data is sourced from [Kaggle Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection/overview) with a train labels file for the ground truths of the images in the train folder. I will be predicting the labels for the images in the test folder. A positive label would be when a 32x32 pixel region of a patch contains at least one pixel of tumor tissue.
